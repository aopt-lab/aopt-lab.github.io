## NEWS

* 2022.03.15: I made this homepage, which introduces research achievements by students in my lab. Because I do not think that many international researchers are interested in them *currently*, I will not frequently update this page. My personal achievements can be found in [this page](https://ryojitanabe.github.io/).
